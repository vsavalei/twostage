The goal of twostage is to two-stage!

## Installation

You can install the development version of twostage from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("vsavalei/twostage")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(twostage)
#> Loading required package: lavaan
#> This is lavaan 0.6-19
#> lavaan is FREE software! Please report any bugs.
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks.

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
