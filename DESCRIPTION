Description: This package contains functions that fit structural equation models 
  (SEMs) to linear composites, formed from components (items). The main 
  application is to treat item-level missing data. The package currently 
  includes the following methods: 
  1) Two-stage ML (TSML) method of Savalei and Rhemtulla (2017a); 
  2) PIM (Pseudo-Indicator Model) method of Rose, Wagner, Mayer, and Nagengast (2019).
  In the future, it will also contain the CCA methods and the 2) GLS method of 
  Savalei and Rhemtulla (2017b). Future developments also include providing accurate
  fit indices for model fit assessments that assess the composite-level model only.
