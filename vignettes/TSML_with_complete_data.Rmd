```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

This is already example 2 under TSML, move to here


```{r render, echo=FALSE}
#note to self: 
#devtools::build_rmd("vignettes/TSML_with_complete_data.Rmd") 
#will render the vignette, against a (temporarily installed) dev version of pkg
```


```{r setup}
library(twostage)
```

While it is probably the case that the user will never consider TSML if they have complete data and are interested in the model for the composites -- because they can just compute the composites in the datafile by summing or averaging relevant items -- it is instructive to see how we can get the same output from TSML.
